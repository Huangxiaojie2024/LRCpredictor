# LRCpredictor: A Computational Framework for Drug Lactation Risk Prediction

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://lrcpredictor.streamlit.app/)

## 📋 Overview

LRCpredictor is a novel interpretable machine learning framework for predicting clinically actionable lactation risk categories of drugs based on Dr. Thomas Hale's evidence-based Lactation Risk Categories (LRC) system. Unlike existing computational models that focus on pharmacokinetic surrogate endpoints (milk-to-plasma ratios), LRCpredictor directly predicts composite risk classifications to support therapeutic decision-making for breastfeeding medication safety.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Clinically Actionable Predictions**: Direct classification of drugs into low-risk (L1/L2) vs. high-risk (L4/L5) categories
- **High Performance**: Test set AUC of 0.8105 and MCC of 0.4926; exceptional performance for extreme categories (L1 vs L5: AUC = 0.9000, MCC = 0.7031)
- **Interpretable Framework**: Integrated SHAP analysis reveals molecular determinants driving lactation risk predictions
- **Web-Based Platform**: Freely accessible online tool with real-time SHAP visualization
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: 392 drugs with documented lactation risk classifications from the latest 2025-2026 LRC system

## 🚀 Online Prediction Platform
